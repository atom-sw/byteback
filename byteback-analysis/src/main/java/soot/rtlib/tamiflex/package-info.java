/**
 * This package contains classes that may be emitted into a program during code generation. If Soot cannot find a class on
 * the soot-classpath then it automatically loads the class from Soot's own JAR file but <i>only</i> if this class is in this
 * package. This is to avoid accidental mix-ups between the classes of the application being analyzed and Soot's own classes.
 *
 * To add a class, use, for example, the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // before calling soot.Main.main
 * Scene.v().addBasicClass(SootSig.class.getName(), SootClass.BODIES);
 * // then at some point
 * Scene.v().getSootClass(SootSig.class.getName()).setApplicationClass();
 * </pre>
 *
 * This will cause Soot to emit the class SootSig along with the analyzed program.
