<body>
Public classes for the SSA Shimple intermediate representation.
<p>
  Basic support for an SSA version of Jimple, dubbed Shimple. The idea
  is that Shimple can be treated almost identically to Jimple with the
  added benefit of SSA form.
<p>
  The public API is described in soot.shimple.Shimple,
  soot.shimple.ShimpleBody and soot.shimple.PhiExpr.
<p>
  Use/Definition and Definition/Use chains for Shimple can be obtained
  with ShimpleLocalDefs and ShimpleLocalUses in
  soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.
<p>
  Available example analyses for Shimple currently include:
  soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.{ShimpleLocalDefs,SEvaluator,SConstantPropagatorAndFolder}
