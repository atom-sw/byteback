Toolkit to produce and manipulate various types of control flow
graphs. While the CFG classes do not impose restrictions on the types
of graph nodes, the nodes are typically instances of {@link Unit}
or {@link Block}. The latter corresponds to basic blocks of
<code>Unit</code>s. Some of the CFG classes include the control
flow corresponding to thrown exceptions, while others
abstract away exception-related edges.
