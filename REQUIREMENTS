# Hardware requirements

The docker image has been built for the amd64 (x86-64) architecture,
and has only been tested on its native architecture. Therefore this
architecture is a requirement for running the replication package.

# Resource requirements

This replication package does not have specific resource requirements.

For smoothly running the experiments we suggest a configuration of at
least 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM.

We ran this replication package on a laptop with a CPU i7-7600U 4x
3.9Ghz and 8GB of RAM. With the default settings the replication of
all the experiments (task results) completed in 18 minutes.

For reference, running the same experiments on better hardware (CPU
i9-12950HX 24x 4.9Ghz, 64 GB of RAM) took 8 minutes.

# Software requirements

In order to deploy the container image it is necessary to install
either [Docker](https://docker.com) or [Podman](https://podman.io).
The container image includes all necessary dependencies to build and
run ByteBack and its experiments.
