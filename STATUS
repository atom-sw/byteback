We believe that our artifact is elegible for the following badges:

- Available: This artifact is publicly available on Figshare.

- Functional: This artifact produces experimental results consistent
  with those reported in the paper, with well-documented steps to
  achieve them.

- Reusable: This artifact can be deployed by either as a Docker image
  or by building it locally with Gradle. The build process clearly
  states all required dependencies. The version of ByteBack shipped
  with this artifact provides the same capabilities as previous
  versions of ByteBack and can be used as a command-line application
  to verify arbitrary bytecode programs beyond the experimental set,
  as shown in the README example.
